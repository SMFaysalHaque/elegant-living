### 📖 **Description:**

**_Elegant Living Furniture_** is a furniture company specializing in a wide variety of wooden products. This e-Commerce website has been developed to facilitate the online sale of their products. Each furniture item includes multiple high-quality images, allowing customers to thoroughly view and evaluate the product before making a purchase. Detailed product descriptions are also provided alongside the images for better understanding.

Customers can view the price and purchase multiple quantities of the same product, as well as add different products to their cart. To place an order, buyers must provide their name, mobile number, email address, and delivery address. After placing the order, a confirmation message is displayed along with a unique order tracking number. If any input field is left incomplete, appropriate error messages are shown, and the order cannot be submitted until all fields are correctly filled. Additionally, the "Checkout" button remains disabled if the cart is empty.

The entire project uses localStorage for data persistence and Context API for state management. This allows the system to reflect real-time stock availability—whether a product is in stock or out of stock—and accordingly enables users to add items to the cart, as well as increase or decrease product quantities.

This small yet effective website successfully handles these functionalities in a clean and user-friendly manner.
